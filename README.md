Exploring Machine Learning Series

The attached dataset has rent details of some houses in Lavasa.
1. What are your observations on the Dataset?
2. What are the different Error Measures (Evaluation Metrics) in relation to Linear Regression? How much do you get in the above cases?
3. Note down the errors/losses when the train-test ratio is 50:50, 60:40, 70:30, and 80:20
4. During LinearRegression() process, what is the impact of giving TRUE/FALSE as the value for Normalize Parameter?
